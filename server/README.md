## Connect to Blockchain
To make use of the blockchain API, deploy a network following the guide in the `/Fabric-Prod-Nw` folder.

The main configuration points are:

1. `.env` file:
    Here the following variables must be configured:
```sh
# The admin user ID of the certification authority of the organization. Cf. Fabric-Prod-Nw
CA_ADMIN_USER_ID=rca-org1-admin
# The password of the CA admin user 
CA_ADMIN_PW=rca-org1-adminpw
# The MSP ID of the organization
MSP_ORG=org1MSP
# The host name of the organizations CA
CA_HOST_NAME=rca-org1
# Name of the channel
CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel
# Name of the deployed chaincode
CHAINCODE_ID=mycc
# The master key that is used to encrypt all user wallets
WALLET_MASTER_KEY=vOVH6sdmpNWjRRIqCc7rdxs01lwHzfr3
```

2. `/assets/connectionProfile.json` file:
    This file defines the necessary information to connect to the organization's peers. Most importantly, the CA certificate and the root TLS certificates must be set. Note that these certificates are newly generated whenever the start script of the blockchain network is run.

If these files were configured correctly, the server will automatically enroll the admin user on startup. This admin user can then enroll new users. Once a new user on the rohstoffboerse is verified, he will be enrolled in the network. His newly generated indentity (certificate + private key) are stored in the MongoDB database in the user schema.
After verification the user can make simple API call using the issued JWT token to query the chaincode. The respective API is defined in `/src/routes/fabric.js`.

For a detailed chaincode API description refer to `/Fabric-Prod-Nw/chaincode`
